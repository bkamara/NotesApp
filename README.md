# NotesApp
Note taking application (AngularJS)

-------
Hello there!

A mobile web note application!

---

//BACKGROUND INFO

It was created with AngularJS as its main framework, with assisted help from jQuery, ngStorage (AngularJS module), and Angular material. Using Google’s material design as inspiration for the look and feel of the application, I have chosen the dark theme, with pink, as the primary palette, light blue, as the main accent.  

//HOW TO…

- Add a new note: Tap on the floating button with the ‘+’ and fill in fields, and press 'Save'.
- View note: Tap on note.
- Delete note: Swipe from right to left on the note you want to delete, then follow through the prompt.
- Update note: Tap on note and edit fields, then click 'Update'.

//NOTE

While viewing or adding text in the note field, some of the words may be hidden. You must tap on the text field and press enter. The full body of the text field should appear.
